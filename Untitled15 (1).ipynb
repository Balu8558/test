    "## **Introduction to Arithmetic Expressions**\n",
    "\n",
    "An **arithmetic expression** is a combination of numbers, variables, and arithmetic operators that represent a mathematical calculation. These expressions are used to perform basic mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "`3 + 5 * 2` or `a + b - c / 2`\n",
    "\n",
    "Arithmetic expressions follow the **operator precedence** rule ‚Äî multiplication and division are performed before addition and subtraction unless parentheses are used to change the order.\n",
    "\n",
    "In programming and mathematics, they are essential for performing calculations, evaluating formulas, and solving problems involving numerical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Would you like me to add the **types of arithmetic expressions (simple, compound, nested)** next?\n"
